Yun (Charles) Ye is an Academic Visitor in the Transport Section of the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Imperial College London, and an Associate Professor at the Faculty of Maritime and Transportation, Ningbo University.   His current research explores human-centered safety in pedestrian–vehicle interactions, with a focus on virtual reality-based behavioral experiments, data-driven and physics-informed modeling, and intelligent transportation systems.

Dr. Ye obtained his PhD from The University of Hong Kong, and his Bachelor of Engineering degree from Zhejiang University.  During his doctoral period, his work aims to better understand the mechanisms of road user behavior under complex traffic scenarios, with an emphasis on developing predictive safety models that support risk assessment and proactive traffic management strategies.

He has been recognized with several honors, including the Yongjiang Talent–Young Innovative Award, the Top Talent distinction by Ningbo City, the Yue-Kong Pao Young Top Scholar Award by Ningbo University, and the Civil Centennial Future Scholars Award from The University of Hong Kong. He has published in leading journals and conferences in the field of traffic safety and intelligence, and has led or participated in over ten research and applied projects related to intelligent transport and traffic safety.
