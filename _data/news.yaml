    We are delighted to announce that [Leandro Parada](/members/parada-l.html) has successfully passed his PhD viva with only minor corrections required.
    
    Dr. Parada's research has focused on multi-agent reinforcement learning methods for the robust, safe, and efficient control of autonomous vehicle fleets across diverse decision-making horizons.
    
    Among his many contributions was his groundbreaking work on detecting and isolating malicious actors who seek to disrupt communication and coordination data streams between interacting autonomous vehicles. By addressing the potential for these actors to manipulate control algorithms or cause accidents, Dr. Parada's work represents a critical step towards ensuring the safe, large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles.
        
    Dr. Parada will continue his research with TSL as part of the DeepSafe project, and we look forward to his future contributions in this exciting field.
