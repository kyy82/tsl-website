- title: Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Management
  subtitle: Risk-aware frameworks for autonomous systems
  group: featured
  image: images/jetracer.jpg
  description: Our research focuses on designing efficient, safe and robust control systems for autonomous vehicle fleets. We develop novel algorithms that optimize routing, scheduling, and operational management while ensuring compliance with safety standards. A key strength of our approach is the development of risk-aware frameworks that combine model-based collision prediction with reinforcement learning.

- title: Agent-based Transport Modeling
  subtitle: Microscopic traffic simulation
  group: theme
  image: images/agent.jpg
  description: Our group develops agent-based models for transport systems that can simulate complex emergent behaviors from the interactions of many individual agents. These models help policymakers understand the impacts of new technologies, regulations, and infrastructure investments before implementation.
