- title: Wuhan Logistics Cluster Masterplan
  subtitle: Strategic Planning for China's OBOR Initiative
  group: theme
  image: images/projects/wuhan-project.jpg
  description: TSL developed a Logistics Masterplan for the Wuhan Logistics Cluster (WLC), commissioned by China's National Development and Reform Commission. The study explored Wuhan's potential to evolve from a regional hinterland port into a major international hub with a significant role in the One-Belt One-Road (OBOR) initiative, connecting directly to European railroad networks.

- title: Electrification of Public Transport
  subtitle: Optimizing Wireless Charging Infrastructure for Electric Buses
  group: theme
  image: images/projects/bus_electric.JPG
  description: We developed a stochastic optimisation model for designing city-wide wireless charging infrastructure for electric buses. Our solution addressed the limitations of electric buses—limited driving range and long recharge times—by proposing Wireless Charging Lanes (WCL) that recharge buses while in motion. The model optimized infrastructure deployment considering various energy consumption scenarios and demonstrated potential annual cost reductions of 24% compared to stationary charging solutions.
